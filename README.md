# intercom
A githubbed version of DIY intercom system based on Mumble voice chat server and headless client running on Raspberry Pis.

Since this project is based on unlicense license, I thought saving it for future generations is worth 10 minutes of my time. I'm not an author nor am I in any way connected with the development (yet!).
