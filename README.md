A githubbed version of DIY intercom system based on Mumble voice chat server and headless client running on Raspberry Pis.

Since this project is based on unlicense license I thought saving it for future generations is worth 10 minutes of my time. I'm not an author nor am I in any way connected to the development (yet!).

Room for improvements:
- MPTCP and/or dual interface networking with gracefull failover (3G/4G + wifi)
- vibration alarm on call
- screensaver mode preventing OLED screen burn-in
